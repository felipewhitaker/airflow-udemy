# Airflow

Airflow is a tool for scheduling processes, usually used by Data Engineering teams. This repository has been created from the classes available at [Apache Airflow: The Hands-On Guide](https://gympass.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-hands-on-course-to-master-apache-airflow/).

## First Project
